# ft_printf Project

This project is a simplified implementation of the `printf` function in C, named `ft_printf`, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.

## Introduction

The `ft_printf` project is a reimplementation of the standard C library function `printf`. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms of the `printf` function and to practice fundamental programming concepts.

## Features

- Supports basic format specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`
- Handles flags, width, precision, and length modifiers (limited set)
- Basic error handling
